# UTIMCO_Parser

PLEASE NOTE: This program is no longer maintained, as I no longer have access to UTIMCO.
I don't imagine anyone will ever use this, but here it is.

A python program designed to download and aggregate data 
for data analysis from UTIMCO's (The University of Texas 
Investment Management Company) website.

This program serves me on a daily basis and makes the 
manipulation and retrieval of data from UTIMCO's website
all the more easy. As it stands, this data aggregation tool
is not yet finished, but is being actively worked on whenever
the time presents itself in my day-to-day working life.
